<h1><center>Let's Talk Art History</center></h1>

<p>    Welcome! This project will hold data about famous artists,
a selection of their works, their artistic movement and time period the artist was popular.
The user will be able to search each of these characteristics. I chose to make a project about art history as art work invites social commentary and robust conversation.
Creative expression is really important to me and I want to share that.</p>
